[scrolling]

# --- MOUSE COPY OPTIMIZATION ---
# If set to 'true', text is copied to the clipboard
# immediately upon selection (letting go of the mouse).

# !! IMPORTANT FOR ZELLIJ !!
# This will ONLY work if you hold 'Shift' while selecting.
# Holding 'Shift' lets Alacritty handle the selection, bypassing zellij.

# --- OSCP OPTIMIZATION (Optional) ---
